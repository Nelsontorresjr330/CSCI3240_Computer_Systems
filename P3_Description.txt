turnin code:  cs_p3


Write a C/C++ program that performs the tasks described below.

The program should accept 2 command-line args, each is the name of a file.
An example execution might be:
    ./p3 /etc/hosts ./tempin

The program should create 2 pthreads, one to read the first file, and one
to read the second file.  Each thread should count the number of occurrences
of the letter 'a' in each file.

The mainline program should wait for the threads to terminate and then print
the results.  The results would be of this format:
    123 /etc/hosts
     44 ./tempin

--------

TURNIN info:
    You should submit a tar file of a directory which contains all of the
    required files (makefile, C source files, header files, etc).
    Sample tar command to create a tar file from a dir:
        tar cvf p3.tar ./p3dir  ## do *NOT* use full pathname of the dir
    After un-tarring the project, I will cd to the dir containing it and type:
        rm -rf p3
        rm -f *.o
        make
    It should build an executable named p3.

    ********
    The submitted file must:
        - be a tar file
        - un-tar into the *correct* set of files (above)
        - build an executable named p3
    else it will NOT be graded further.
