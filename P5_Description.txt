                                 Project 5


turnin code:  cs_p5


Have your main program do this at the start of execution:

    alarm(90);
    p5siggy();       // linked from our public directory (see below)

The program should then prepare to receive these 2 types of signals:
    SIGUSR1
    SIGUSR2

The program should then go into a loop doing this:
    sleep(1);
until it has received 6 signals.

On receiving each signal, the program should print:
    handling SIGxxxx  where xxxx is replaced by the name of the signal

After receiving the 6th signal, the program should terminate.

Your program should link with a function named p5siggy from:
    /nfshome/rbutler/public/courses/cs/p5siggy.o


--------

TURNIN info:
    You should submit a tar file of a directory which contains all of the
    required files (makefile, C source files, header files, etc).
    Sample tar command to create a tar file from a dir:
        tar cvf p5.tar ./p5dir  ## do *NOT* use full pathname of the dir
    After un-tarring the project, we will cd to the dir containing it and type:
        rm -rf p5
        rm -f *.o
        make
    It should build an executable named p5.

    ********
    The submitted file must:
        - be a tar file
        - un-tar into the *correct* set of files (above)
        - build an executable named p5
    else it will NOT be graded further.
