                                 Project 4


turnin code:  cs_p4


Write a C/C++ program that performs the tasks described below.

The program will be given 1-3 cmd-line args, e.g.:
    ./p4 /bin/date
    ./p4 /bin/cat /etc/hosts
    ./p4 /bin/echo  foo  bar

The program should use execve (or your choice from the exec family of
functions) to exec the program specified as the first argument, and
provide the last one or two arguments to the program that is exec'd.


--------

TURNIN info:
    You should submit a tar file of a directory which contains all of the
    required files (makefile, C source files, header files, etc).
    Sample tar command to create a tar file from a dir:
        tar cvf p4.tar ./p4dir  ## do *NOT* use full pathname of the dir
    After un-tarring the project, I will cd to the dir containing it and type:
        rm -rf p4
        rm -f *.o
        make
    It should build an executable named p4.

    ********
    The submitted file must:
        - be a tar file
        - un-tar into the *correct* set of files (above)
        - build an executable named p4
    else it will NOT be graded further.
