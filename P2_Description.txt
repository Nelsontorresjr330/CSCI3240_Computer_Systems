                                  Project 2


turnin code:  cs_p2


Write a C/C++ program that performs the tasks described below.

The program should provide a function named mm_alloc.

This is the function prototype:

    void *mm_alloc(int num_bytes_to_allocate)

mm_alloc function should obtain space for the user from a block which you
obtain via mmap.  You should obtain the block on the first invocation
and the block size should be some number of pages.  The number of pages in
the block should be obtained from the environment variable named:
    P2_NUM_PAGES

I will write a set of test programs which invoke your function.

The program must align requests on 16-byte addresses.

If the user attempts to allocate more space than is available, then 
return NULL.


BUILDING AND TESTING:
    Your program MUST NOT include a main procedure; that will be supplied to
    you in a source program named p2main.c

    Your makefile should compile both your code and the source program named
    p2main.c linking them into into a single executable named p2

    I will supply multiple versions of p2main.c and re-build for each one.

--------

TURNIN info:
    You should submit a tar file of a directory which contains all of the
    required files (makefile, C source files, header files, etc).
    Sample tar command to create a tar file from a dir:
        tar cvf p2.tar ./p2dir  ## do *NOT* use full pathname of the dir
    After un-tarring the project, I will cd to the dir containing it and type:
        rm -rf p2
        rm -f *.o
        make
    It should build an executable named p2.

    ********
    The submitted file must:
        - be a tar file
        - un-tar into the *correct* set of files (above)
        - build an executable named p2
    else it will NOT be graded further.
